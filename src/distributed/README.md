This specific section presents and describes the communication system of EDDL developed *ad hoc* to run training procedures in a distributed way.

## Notice

**This is a very draft version, not ready to be used or tested**


## EDDL communication system

### The following figures give a general overview of the communication system:

- Diagram to illustrate report of gradients from worker nodes to the master node and update weights from master node to worker nodes in the EDDL (used in the proposal): ![Distributed Learning flow proposed for the EDDL](images/hybrid-graph-2.svg.png)
- Diagram of the communication system for the EDDL: ![Diagram of the communication system for the EDDL](images/EDDL-distributed-schema.png)
- Flowchart of the Master node: ![Flowchart of the Master node](images/Master-Node.png)
- Flowchart of Worker nodes: ![Flowchart of Worker nodes](images/Worker-Node.png)
- Timeline of network parameters interchange between master node and worker nodes: ![Timeline of network parameters interchange between master node and worker nodes](images/Timeline-in-master-and-worker-nodes.png)


## Progress and coverage
