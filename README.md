**EDDL** is an open source library for Distributed Deep Learning and Tensor Operations in C++ for **CPU**, **GPU** and **FPGA**. EDDL is developed inside the DeepHealth project. For more information about DeepHealth project go to: [deephealth-project.eu](https://deephealth-project.eu/)

## Notice

Please note that EDDL is an ambitious project with few hands on it. Our short-term goal is to have an **stable** version with an easy installation over different platforms. Our second mid-term goal is to provide a good **coverage** of functionalities. And finally, our long-term goal is to improve the **performance** on the different devices.

 *"Plans are only good intentions unless they immediately degenerate into hard work"*
